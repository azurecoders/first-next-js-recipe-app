# NEXT JS Dummy Food Recipe Website

This is my first project of NextJS. I have been learning NextJS from **[Sangam Mukherjee](https://www.youtube.com/@sangammukherjee)** Youtube Channel.

This is this first project and I have also followed him.

This project I have created without help after completing it once by seeing it.
